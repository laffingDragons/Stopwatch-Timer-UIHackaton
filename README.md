## üåü About TimeMaster

TimeMaster is not just a stopwatch and timer‚Äîit's an experience. Designed with a focus on aesthetics and functionality, this web app combines a futuristic **neomorphic UI** with subtle, dynamic particle effects to create a time-tracking tool that‚Äôs as beautiful as it is practical. Whether you're timing a workout, a study session, or a cooking recipe, TimeMaster makes every second visually engaging.

- **Neomorphic Design**: Boxy, tactile buttons with a press-in effect for a modern, premium feel.
- **Dynamic Particle Trails**: Background particles with trails that follow their movement, slowing down in stopwatch mode and speeding up in timer mode for an immersive experience.
- **Shake to Start/Stop**: Intuitive shake detection for hands-free control on mobile devices.
- **Customizable Presets**: Quick timer presets (1m, 3m, 5m, 10m) with animated feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for a modular, component-based architecture.
- **Styling**: CSS with custom variables for themes and color schemes.
- **Animations**: Anime.js for smooth button presses and particle effects.
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering dynamic particle trails in the background.
- **Device Motion API**: Enables shake-to-start/stop functionality on mobile devices.

## ‚ú® What Makes TimeMaster Stand Out?

### 1. Neomorphic UI
We ditched traditional flat buttons for a **neomorphic design**, giving the controls a tactile, 3D feel. The buttons feature a subtle press-in animation, making interactions satisfying and intuitive.

### 2. Dynamic Particle Trails
The background isn‚Äôt just a static layer‚Äîit‚Äôs alive! Each particle has a fading trail that follows its movement:
- In **Stopwatch** mode, particles slow down to 30% speed, creating a calming effect as time progresses.
- In **Timer** mode, particles speed up to 150% speed, adding urgency as the countdown ticks down.
- Trails are rendered using the Canvas API, ensuring smooth performance even on low-end devices.

### 3. Bug-Free Experience
We tackled common issues head-on:
- Fixed an infinite loop in the timer input logic (`TimerInput.jsx`) to ensure smooth state updates.
- Separated stopwatch and timer logic for reliable, independent operation.
- Removed visual glitches in button animations for a polished user experience.

### 4. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Keyboard navigation support for all controls.
- Responsive design that adapts to any screen size.
- High-contrast themes (light/dark) for better visibility.
